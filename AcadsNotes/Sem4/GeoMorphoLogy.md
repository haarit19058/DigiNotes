# What is realism


Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the meanings of the terms related to different types of realism:

### 1. **Realism**:

- **Meaning**: Realism refers to a philosophy or approach that aims to represent the world as it actually is, based on observable and measurable facts. In science and modeling, realism focuses on understanding and simulating processes and phenomena as accurately as possible, grounded in physical principles.
- **Example**: A process-based model that replicates the physical erosion and sediment transport on a hillslope.

### 2. **Apparent Realism**:

- **Meaning**: Apparent realism refers to creating models or representations that look realistic but may not accurately represent the underlying processes. It prioritizes outcomes that appear plausible without strict adherence to mechanistic or physical correctness.
- **Example**: A landscape model that visually mimics a natural terrain but uses simplified rules or heuristics rather than actual physical equations.

### 3. **Statistical Realism**:

- **Meaning**: Statistical realism relies on statistical relationships or patterns to approximate reality. It does not necessarily explain why these relationships exist but uses them for prediction or description.
- **Example**: A regression model predicting rainfall based on historical data without modeling atmospheric processes.

### 4. **Essential Realism**:

- **Meaning**: Essential realism emphasizes capturing the fundamental or "essential" elements of a system while abstracting or ignoring less critical details. It focuses on representing the core dynamics that govern a system.
- **Example**: A simplified hydrological model that focuses only on the primary water flow pathways without accounting for minor factors like microtopography.

### Summary:

- **Realism**: Accurate and mechanistic.
- **Apparent Realism**: Looks realistic but may lack depth or accuracy in processes.
- **Statistical Realism**: Based on data patterns, not necessarily mechanistic understanding.
- **Essential Realism**: Focused on core processes while abstracting non-essential details.
