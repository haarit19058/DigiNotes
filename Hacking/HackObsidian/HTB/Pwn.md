The output of `pwn checksec` provides security-related information about the binary `regularity`. Here’s what each field means:

1. **Arch: amd64-64-little**
    
    - The binary is compiled for **64-bit x86 (AMD64)** architecture and uses **little-endian** byte order.
2. **RELRO: No RELRO**
    
    - **RELRO (Relocation Read-Only)** is a security feature that makes the Global Offset Table (GOT) read-only to prevent overwriting function pointers.
    - **No RELRO** means the GOT is **writable**, making it vulnerable to certain exploits like GOT overwrite attacks.
3. **Stack: No canary found**
    
    - **Stack canaries** are special values placed on the stack to detect buffer overflows.
    - **No canary found** means the binary lacks this protection, making it more vulnerable to stack-based buffer overflows.
4. **NX: NX unknown - GNU_STACK missing**
    
    - **NX (Non-Executable Stack)** prevents code execution from stack memory, protecting against shellcode injection.
    - **NX unknown - GNU_STACK missing** means the binary does not contain the `GNU_STACK` ELF header, which prevents `checksec` from determining if NX is enabled.
    - This usually indicates that the binary may have an **executable stack**, making it easier to execute injected shellcode.
5. **PIE: No PIE (0x400000)**
    
    - **PIE (Position Independent Executable)** makes address locations random at runtime, making memory corruption exploits harder.
    - **No PIE** means the binary is loaded at a **fixed address (0x400000)**, making Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) easier.
6. **Stack: Executable**
    
    - The stack is **executable**, meaning arbitrary shellcode could run from the stack, making exploits much easier.
7. **RWX: Has RWX segments**
    
    - The binary has **memory segments that are both Readable, Writable, and Executable**.
    - This is a major security risk, as it allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code.
8. **Stripped: No**
    
    - The binary is **not stripped**, meaning it still contains function symbols and debugging information.
    - This makes reverse engineering easier.

### **Security Implications**

This binary is highly **vulnerable to exploitation**:

- **No stack canary** → Stack buffer overflows are easier.
- **Executable stack** → Shellcode injection is possible.
- **No RELRO & RWX segments** → Function pointers in memory can be overwritten.
- **No PIE** → Static addresses make ROP easier.

### **Next Steps**

- If you're **exploiting** the binary, you have multiple attack surfaces available.
- If you're **defending**, recompile with security features:
    
    ```sh
    gcc -fstack-protector -z noexecstack -z relro -z now -pie -fPIC -o secure_binary source.c
    ```
    

Let me know if you need further explanation or help with exploitation/mitigation!
