NASM (Netwide Assembler) is an open-source assembler for the x86 architecture. It is used to convert human-readable assembly language code into machine-readable object code (binary format). NASM is widely used because of its simplicity, portability, and support for multiple output formats.

---

### **Key Features of NASM**

- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, Windows, and other platforms.
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Supports formats like ELF (Linux), PE (Windows), Mach-O (macOS), and flat binary.
- **Modular and Flexible**: Allows writing clear and efficient assembly code with macros and structured programming techniques.
- **Supports x86 and x86-64**: You can write 32-bit and 64-bit assembly programs.

---

### **Why Use NASM?**

- **Precise Control**: Direct control over the CPU, registers, and memory.
- **Low-Level Programming**: Ideal for performance-critical applications, bootloaders, or understanding hardware.
- **Educational Use**: Helps learn computer architecture and low-level programming.

---

### **How to Install NASM on Linux**

On Arch Linux (your setup):

```bash
sudo pacman -S nasm
```

On Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nasm
```

---

### **How NASM Works**

1. **Assembly**: Translates `.asm` files into `.o` (object files).
2. **Linking**: The object file is linked using a linker (like `ld`) to produce an executable.
3. **Execution**: The executable runs directly on the CPU.

---

### **Basic NASM Syntax**

```asm
section .data       ; Data segment
    msg db "Hello", 0 ; Declare a string with a null terminator

section .text       ; Code segment
    global _start   ; Entry point

_start:
    mov eax, 1      ; Syscall for exit
    xor ebx, ebx    ; Return code 0
    int 0x80        ; Call kernel
```

Running assembly code in Linux involves writing, assembling, linking, and executing the code. Here's a step-by-step guide:

---

### **Step 1: Write the Assembly Code**

1. Create an assembly source file with a `.asm` or `.s` extension:
    
    ```bash
    nano hello.asm
    ```
    
2. Example assembly code (`hello.asm`):
    
    ```asm
    section .data
        msg db "Hello, World!", 0xA ; Message with a newline
        len equ $ - msg             ; Message length
    
    section .text
        global _start
    
    _start:
        mov eax, 4                  ; syscall: write
        mov ebx, 1                  ; file descriptor: stdout
        mov ecx, msg                ; message address
        mov edx, len                ; message length
        int 0x80                    ; call kernel
    
        mov eax, 1                  ; syscall: exit
        xor ebx, ebx                ; return code: 0
        int 0x80                    ; call kernel
    ```
    

---

### **Step 2: Assemble the Code**

Use `nasm` (Netwide Assembler) to assemble the code:

```bash
sudo pacman -S nasm       # Install nasm if not already installed
nasm -f elf32 -o hello.o hello.asm
```

---

### **Step 3: Link the Code**

Use `ld` (GNU linker) to link the object file and produce an executable:

```bash
ld -m elf_i386 -o hello hello.o
```

---

### **Step 4: Run the Executable**

Run the executable file:

```bash
./hello
```

---

### **Step 5: Verify Output**

You should see:

```
Hello, World!
```

---

### **Additional Notes**

- **32-bit vs. 64-bit Code**: The above example uses 32-bit assembly and system calls. For 64-bit assembly, replace `int 0x80` with `syscall` and update registers like `eax` to `rax`, `ebx` to `rdi`, etc.
- **Install Required Tools**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S binutils gcc
    ```
    
- **Troubleshooting**:
    - Ensure you use `-m elf_i386` when linking 32-bit code.
    - For 64-bit code, ensure you're using `nasm -f elf64` and omit `-m elf_i386`.

# ELF file format

**ELF (Executable and Linkable Format)** is a standard file format for executable files, object files, shared libraries, and core dumps. It is widely used on Unix-like operating systems such as Linux. Developed by Unix System Laboratories and standardized by the System V ABI (Application Binary Interface), ELF provides a flexible and extensible format for program execution and dynamic linking.

---

### **Key Components of ELF**

An ELF file is divided into sections and segments, with the specific layout depending on its purpose (e.g., executable, object file, or library).

#### **1. ELF Header**

- Located at the very start of the ELF file.
- Contains metadata about the file, such as:
    - File type (e.g., executable, object file, or shared library).
    - Target architecture (e.g., x86, x86_64, ARM).
    - Endianness (little-endian or big-endian).
    - Entry point address (where execution starts for executables).
    - Offset and size of other sections (e.g., program headers, section headers).

#### **2. Program Header Table**

- Describes the segments in the ELF file, which are used during execution.
- Each segment corresponds to a portion of the file loaded into memory.
- Includes information like:
    - Segment type (e.g., loadable, dynamic linking info).
    - Virtual address where the segment should be loaded.
    - Permissions (read/write/execute).

#### **3. Section Header Table**

- Describes the sections in the ELF file, which are used during linking and debugging.
- Each section contains specific types of data (e.g., code, symbols, strings).
- Common sections:
    - `.text`: Contains the program’s executable code.
    - `.data`: Contains initialized global and static variables.
    - `.bss`: Contains uninitialized global and static variables (allocated at runtime).
    - `.rodata`: Contains read-only data, such as string literals.
    - `.symtab` and `.strtab`: Symbol table and string table used for linking.
    - `.debug`: Debugging information (optional).

#### **4. Data Sections**

- **.text**: Executable instructions.
- **.data**: Initialized data (e.g., global variables initialized in the program).
- **.bss**: Uninitialized data; occupies no space in the file but is allocated in memory.
- **.rodata**: Read-only data, such as constants and string literals.

---

### **ELF File Types**

1. **Relocatable (`ET_REL`)**:
    
    - Contains code and data that can be combined with other object files to create an executable or shared object.
    - Example: Object files generated during compilation (`.o` files).
2. **Executable (`ET_EXEC`)**:
    
    - A complete, standalone program ready to run.
    - Example: Linux binaries (`a.out` or custom executables).
3. **Shared Object (`ET_DYN`)**:
    
    - A file designed to be dynamically linked with executables or other shared objects.
    - Example: `.so` files in Linux.
4. **Core Dump (`ET_CORE`)**:
    
    - A snapshot of a program’s memory and execution state at the time of a crash.
    - Used for debugging.

---

### **ELF File Layout**

The ELF file consists of the following parts:

```
+--------------------+
| ELF Header         |
+--------------------+
| Program Headers    |
+--------------------+
| Sections           |
|   .text            |
|   .data            |
|   .bss             |
|   ...              |
+--------------------+
| Section Headers    |
+--------------------+
```

---

### **How ELF is Used**

1. **Compiling**:
    
    - The compiler generates an ELF object file from source code.
    - Example: `gcc -c hello.c` produces `hello.o` (relocatable ELF).
2. **Linking**:
    
    - The linker combines multiple ELF object files into a single ELF executable or shared object.
    - Example: `gcc -o hello hello.o` produces an executable ELF.
3. **Loading**:
    
    - The loader (part of the OS kernel) reads the ELF file to:
        - Validate its structure.
        - Load segments into memory.
        - Transfer control to the entry point.
4. **Dynamic Linking**:
    
    - Shared libraries (ELF `ET_DYN`) are linked at runtime.

---

### **Advantages of ELF**

1. **Platform Independence**:
    
    - The format is extensible and used across multiple Unix-like platforms.
2. **Dynamic Linking**:
    
    - Supports shared libraries, reducing memory usage and binary size.
3. **Rich Debugging Support**:
    
    - Includes sections for debugging symbols and information.
4. **Efficient Loading**:
    
    - Segments allow loading only relevant parts of the file into memory.

---

### **Examples**

#### **Relocatable ELF**

Assemble a simple `.asm` file into an ELF object:

```asm
section .text
    global _start
_start:
    mov eax, 1          ; sys_exit
    mov ebx, 0          ; exit code 0
    int 0x80
```

Command:

```bash
nasm -f elf32 -o hello.o hello.asm
```

#### **Executable ELF**

Link the object file to create an ELF executable:

```bash
ld -m elf_i386 -o hello hello.o
```

#### **Inspect ELF File**

View ELF headers using `readelf` or `objdump`:

```bash
readelf -h hello
objdump -f hello
```
