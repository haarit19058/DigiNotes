# Multi threading using pragma  

Here's the rewritten version of your code with explanations for the `#pragma omp` directives:

### Rewritten Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstdlib>  // For rand()
#include <ctime>    // For seeding rand()
#include <omp.h>    // For OpenMP

using namespace std;

// Function to generate a random n x n matrix
vector<vector<int>> generateMatrix(int n) {
    vector<vector<int>> matrix(n, vector<int>(n));
    #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2)  // Parallelize both loops
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            matrix[i][j] = rand() % 10;  // Random number between 0 and 9
        }
    }
    return matrix;
}

// Function to multiply two matrices
vector<vector<int>> multiplyMatrices(const vector<vector<int>>& mat1, const vector<vector<int>>& mat2, int n) {
    vector<vector<int>> result(n, vector<int>(n, 0));  // Initialize result matrix with zeros
    
    // Matrix multiplication
    #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2)  // Parallelize both i and j loops
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
                result[i][j] += mat1[i][k] * mat2[k][j];
            }
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Function to print a matrix
void printMatrix(const vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
    for (const auto& row : matrix) {
        for (int val : row) {
            cout << val << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    srand(time(0));  // Seed the random number generator

    int n;
    cout << "Enter the size of the matrices (n x n): ";
    cin >> n;

    // Generate two random n x n matrices
    vector<vector<int>> matrix1 = generateMatrix(n);
    vector<vector<int>> matrix2 = generateMatrix(n);

    // Multiply the matrices
    vector<vector<int>> result = multiplyMatrices(matrix1, matrix2, n);

    // Print the matrices and the result
    cout << "\nMatrix 1:" << endl;
    printMatrix(matrix1);

    cout << "\nMatrix 2:" << endl;
    printMatrix(matrix2);

    cout << "\nResult (Matrix 1 x Matrix 2):" << endl;
    printMatrix(result);

    return 0;
}
```

### What Does `#pragma omp parallel for` Do?

- **`#pragma omp parallel for`:** This directive tells the compiler to parallelize the following loop. It divides the iterations of the loop among multiple threads that run concurrently. It enables parallel processing to improve performance, particularly for large data sets or compute-intensive tasks.
  
  In your case:
  - For the **matrix generation** loop, OpenMP parallelizes the iteration over the indices `(i, j)` so that different rows and columns can be generated simultaneously by different threads.
  - For **matrix multiplication**, OpenMP parallelizes the multiplication over both the `i` (row) and `j` (column) indices, allowing multiple elements of the result matrix to be computed simultaneously by different threads.

### `collapse(2)`:

- **`collapse(2)`** is used when there are nested loops (like the ones in matrix generation and multiplication). It tells OpenMP to treat the two loops (`i` and `j` in this case) as one larger loop, effectively parallelizing both the outer and inner loops together. This can provide better load balancing and thread utilization, especially for larger matrices. 

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Added `#pragma omp parallel for collapse(2)`** to parallelize the nested loops in matrix generation and multiplication.
2. **Printed matrices and the result matrix** to check the correctness of the program.
















Here's a quick guide to using the `make` command and writing `Makefiles` to compile C programs:

### 1. **The `make` Command Basics**
The `make` command automates the process of building executable programs and libraries from source code by reading files called `Makefiles`.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Automatic Dependency Tracking**: It tracks which files need to be recompiled based on changes.
  - **Efficient Compilation**: Only the files that have changed are recompiled.
  - **Custom Commands**: You can specify custom commands (for running tests, cleaning up files, etc.).

### 2. **Basic Structure of a Makefile**
A `Makefile` contains rules to tell `make` how to build your program. The general format of a rule is:

```make
target: dependencies
    command
```

- **Target**: The file or thing you want to generate (e.g., the final executable).
- **Dependencies**: The files that the target depends on (e.g., source files, headers).
- **Command**: The shell command to run to build the target (this must be indented with a **TAB**).

### 3. **Simple Example**

Let's say you have a program made up of two C files (`main.c` and `helper.c`) and a header file (`helper.h`).

#### Directory Structure:
```
project/
├── Makefile
├── main.c
├── helper.c
└── helper.h
```

#### Makefile:
```make
# Variables
CC = gcc        # Compiler
CFLAGS = -Wall  # Compiler flags

# Target to build the executable 'program'
program: main.o helper.o
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o program main.o helper.o

# Rule to compile 'main.c' into 'main.o'
main.o: main.c helper.h
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c main.c

# Rule to compile 'helper.c' into 'helper.o'
helper.o: helper.c helper.h
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c helper.c

# Clean up object files and the executable
clean:
    rm -f *.o program
```

### **Explanation**:
1. **Variables**:  
   - `CC = gcc`: This sets `gcc` as the compiler.  
   - `CFLAGS = -Wall`: This adds compiler flags (`-Wall` to enable all warnings).
   
2. **Target: `program`**:
   - **Dependencies**: `main.o` and `helper.o`.
   - **Command**: Compiles these object files into the final executable `program`.
   
3. **Target: `main.o`**:
   - **Dependencies**: `main.c` and `helper.h` (because `main.c` includes `helper.h`).
   - **Command**: Compiles `main.c` into an object file `main.o`.

4. **Target: `helper.o`**:
   - **Dependencies**: `helper.c` and `helper.h`.
   - **Command**: Compiles `helper.c` into `helper.o`.

5. **Target: `clean`**:
   - This target doesn't have dependencies. It runs the `rm -f *.o program` command to clean up the object files and the executable.

### 4. **Running `make`**
In the terminal, navigate to your project directory and run:
```bash
make
```

- `make` will look for a file called `Makefile` (or `makefile`) in the current directory.
- It will start by building the **default target** (which is `program` in this case).
  
To **clean** the directory, you can run:
```bash
make clean
```
This will remove the object files and the executable, allowing you to rebuild everything from scratch.

### 5. **Phony Targets**
The `clean` target doesn’t produce a file, so it’s called a **phony target**. To avoid confusion, you can explicitly mark it as such:
```make
.PHONY: clean
```

### 6. **Makefile with Automatic Variables**
You can use built-in variables in `Makefiles` to reduce repetition:
- `$@`: The name of the target.
- `$<`: The first dependency.
- `$^`: All dependencies.

#### Updated Makefile:
```make
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall

program: main.o helper.o
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $^

%.o: %.c
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $<

clean:
    rm -f *.o program
```

### **Explanation of Changes**:
- The rule `%.o: %.c` is a **pattern rule**. It tells `make` how to build any `.o` file from a `.c` file.
- `$@` refers to the target (e.g., `program` or `main.o`).
- `$^` refers to all dependencies (e.g., `main.o helper.o`).
- `$<` refers to the first dependency (e.g., `main.c` or `helper.c`).

### 7. **Common `make` Commands**
- `make`: Build the default target (usually the first target in the `Makefile`).
- `make clean`: Run the `clean` target to remove files.
- `make -j4`: Build with 4 parallel jobs to speed up the process.
- `make target`: Build a specific target (e.g., `make program`).

This should give you a solid understanding of how to use `make` and write `Makefiles`. Let me know if you need more details!

---

### Summary of Key Steps in File Handling
1. **Open the File**: Use `fopen()`.
2. **Read/Write Operations**: Use `fscanf()`, `fprintf()`, `fgets()`, `fputs()`, etc.
3. **Move the Pointer**: Use `fseek()` or `rewind()`.
4. **Close the File**: Use `fclose()` to release resources.

By using these functions, you can efficiently perform file operations in C.



# perror


The `perror()` function in C is used to print a descriptive error message to `stderr` based on the current value of the global variable `errno`. This function is helpful for debugging and error reporting, especially when dealing with system or library function calls that may fail.

### Function Prototype
```c
void perror(const char *s);
```

### Arguments
- **`s`**: A string to be printed before the error message. This can be used to provide context for the error message (e.g., the name of the function or operation that failed).

### Behavior
- `perror()` prints the string `s`, followed by a colon and a space, followed by a description of the last error that occurred (as indicated by `errno`).
- If `s` is `NULL` or an empty string, only the error message is printed.

### Error Messages
The error message is derived from the global variable `errno`, which is set by system and library functions to indicate the error code when an error occurs. Common error codes include `ENOENT` (No such file or directory), `EACCES` (Permission denied), and many others.

### Example Usage

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    FILE *file = fopen("nonexistentfile.txt", "r");
    if (file == NULL) {
        perror("Error opening file");
        // Output: Error opening file: No such file or directory
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
- **`fopen("nonexistentfile.txt", "r")`**: Tries to open a file that does not exist, which will fail and set `errno`.
- **`perror("Error opening file")`**: Prints a message to `stderr` indicating that there was an error opening the file, followed by a description of the error.

### Key Points
- **Global Variable `errno`**: Automatically set by many system calls and library functions to indicate the error code.
- **Error Descriptions**: The actual error description is usually provided in a human-readable format, and it depends on the implementation of the C standard library and operating system.

Using `perror()` helps in providing a clear and contextual error message, making it easier to debug issues in your programs.

# what are global error that perrro use to represent

The term "global error number" refers to the `errno` variable in C, which is used to indicate the status of the last error that occurred during system or library function calls. Here’s a detailed explanation:

### Understanding `errno`

#### 1. **Definition**
- `errno` is a global integer variable defined in `<errno.h>`.
- It is used to store error codes that represent various types of errors encountered during function executions.

#### 2. **Usage**
- When a system call or library function encounters an error, it typically sets `errno` to a specific error code. This error code is a constant defined in `<errno.h>`.
- You can then use `errno` to determine the type of error that occurred and handle it appropriately.

#### 3. **Common Error Codes**
- Some common error codes include:
  - `ENOENT`: No such file or directory.
  - `EACCES`: Permission denied.
  - `ENOMEM`: Out of memory.
  - `EINVAL`: Invalid argument.

#### 4. **Example Usage**
Here’s a simple example demonstrating how `errno` is used with `perror()` to handle errors:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    FILE *file = fopen("nonexistentfile.txt", "r");
    if (file == NULL) {
        // Print the error message associated with the current value of errno
        perror("Error opening file");
        // Output: Error opening file: No such file or directory
    }
    return 0;
}
```

#### 5. **How `errno` Works**
- **Setting `errno`**: Functions that set `errno` generally return a special value (like `NULL` for `fopen()` or `-1` for `read()`) to indicate that an error occurred.
- **Error Codes**: The specific error code is stored in `errno` and can be used to identify the error.
- **Clearing `errno`**: `errno` is not cleared automatically between function calls. It remains set to the last error code until it is overwritten by a subsequent function call that sets `errno` or until the program ends.

#### 6. **Important Notes**
- **Thread Safety**: `errno` is thread-local in POSIX systems, meaning each thread has its own `errno` variable. This avoids conflicts in multi-threaded programs.
- **Checking for Errors**: Always check for errors immediately after the function call that may fail and before calling another function that might overwrite `errno`.

Using `errno` effectively allows you to diagnose issues and handle errors gracefully in your C programs.




# Multithreading in c using pthreads

## creating and joining threads

Creating and joining threads are two fundamental operations in multithreading with pthreads:

### Creating Threads

When you create a thread, you are essentially launching a new path of execution within your program. Each thread can run concurrently with other threads, allowing for parallelism. In pthreads, you use the `pthread_create` function to create a thread.

**Syntax**:
```c
pthread_create(&thread, NULL, thread_function, argument);
```

- **`&thread`**: A pointer to a `pthread_t` variable that will hold the thread identifier.
- **`NULL`**: Thread attributes (or `NULL` for default attributes).
- **`thread_function`**: The function that the thread will execute.
- **`argument`**: A pointer to any data you want to pass to the thread function.

### Joining Threads

Joining a thread means waiting for that thread to finish its execution before proceeding. This is important for synchronization—ensuring that the main thread (or other threads) does not continue until the joined thread has completed its task.

You use the `pthread_join` function to join a thread.

**Syntax**:
```c
pthread_join(thread, NULL);
```

- **`thread`**: The thread identifier of the thread you want to join.
- **`NULL`**: A pointer to store the return value from the thread (or `NULL` if you don’t need it).

### Example in Context

1. **Creating**: When you create multiple threads to perform tasks (like rows of matrix multiplication), each thread runs concurrently and independently.
  
2. **Joining**: After creating these threads, you call `pthread_join` for each thread to ensure that the main program waits for all threads to complete before accessing shared resources (like printing the results of matrix multiplication).

### Why This Matters

- **Concurrency**: Creating threads allows your program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, improving performance for certain workloads.
- **Synchronization**: Joining threads ensures that you handle the program's flow correctly, avoiding issues like accessing incomplete data or resources.

In summary, creating threads starts concurrent execution, while joining threads ensures that the program waits for those executions to finish, maintaining a structured flow.



## Example of how to code the pthreads

Using pthreads in C allows you to create multiple threads within a single process, enabling concurrent execution. Below, I'll outline how to use pthreads for matrix multiplication by dividing one of the matrices into parts and assigning each part to a different thread.

### Steps to Use Pthreads for Matrix Multiplication

1. **Include Necessary Headers**: Include the `pthread.h` for thread handling and `stdio.h` for input/output.

2. **Define the Matrices**: Create global matrices for the multiplication.

3. **Define Thread Function**: Create a function that each thread will execute. This function will perform multiplication for a specific row of the result matrix.

4. **Create Threads**: Use `pthread_create` to create threads, passing the necessary parameters to the thread function.

5. **Join Threads**: Use `pthread_join` to wait for all threads to complete before proceeding.

6. **Compile with Pthreads**: Ensure to compile your code with `-pthread` flag.

### Example Code

Here is a complete example of matrix multiplication using pthreads:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pthread.h>

#define N 4  // Matrix size

// Global matrices
int A[N][N], B[N][N], C[N][N];

// Structure to hold thread data
typedef struct {
    int row;  // Row index for the result matrix
} ThreadData;

// Function executed by each thread
void* multiply(void* arg) {
    ThreadData* data = (ThreadData*)arg;
    int row = data->row;

    for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
        C[row][j] = 0;
        for (int k = 0; k < N; k++) {
            C[row][j] += A[row][k] * B[k][j];
        }
    }
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t threads[N];
    ThreadData thread_data[N];

    // Initialize matrices A and B
    printf("Enter elements for matrix A:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
        for (int j = 0; j < N; j++)
            scanf("%d", &A[i][j]);

    printf("Enter elements for matrix B:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
        for (int j = 0; j < N; j++)
            scanf("%d", &B[i][j]);

    // Create threads
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        thread_data[i].row = i;
        pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, multiply, (void*)&thread_data[i]);
    }

    // Join threads
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        pthread_join(threads[i], NULL);
    }

    // Print result matrix C
    printf("Result matrix C:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
            printf("%d ", C[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}

- **Matrix Declaration**: We declare two input matrices `A` and `B` and one output matrix `C`.

- **ThreadData Structure**: This holds data needed for each thread—in this case, the row index.

- **multiply Function**: This function computes the result for one row of the result matrix `C`.

- **Main Function**:
  - Initializes matrices `A` and `B` by taking user input.
  - Creates threads, each responsible for computing one row of the result matrix.
  - Joins all threads to ensure completion before printing the result.

### Compiling and Running

To compile this code, save it as `matrix_multiplication.c` and run:

```bash
gcc -pthread matrix_multiplication.c -o matrix_multiplication
./matrix_multiplication
```

Make sure to enter the elements for matrices `A` and `B` when prompted. This will multiply them and display the result.



# Why void in multiply in pthread

The reason why the thread function (`start_routine`) in `pthread_create` must accept a `void*` argument and return a `void*` is due to flexibility and generality in C's POSIX threads (`pthreads`). Here's a detailed explanation of why this is the case:

### 1. **Argument Flexibility (`void* arg`)**
The thread function (`multiply` in your case) needs to accept a single argument of type `void*` because:
- **Pointer to any type**: In C, `void*` is a generic pointer that can point to any data type. By using `void*`, the `pthread_create` function can pass any kind of data (e.g., a structure, array, or basic data type) to the thread function, regardless of its type.
- **Thread-specific data**: Since each thread might need to operate on different data (e.g., a specific portion of a matrix), the `arg` parameter allows you to pass different arguments to each thread.

In your example:

```c
ThreadData* data = (ThreadData*)arg;
```

You cast the generic `void*` argument to a specific `ThreadData*` type so that you can access the specific data relevant to this thread (such as `start_col`, `end_col`, etc.).

### 2. **Return Type Flexibility (`void*`)**
The return type of the thread function must also be `void*` because:
- **Return values from threads**: Threads might need to return results or statuses to the main program when they finish. By using `void*`, any type of data can be returned (or `NULL` if no value needs to be returned).
- **Generalized return mechanism**: If a specific return type were required (e.g., `int` or `float`), it would limit the kinds of information that a thread could return. With `void*`, the function can return any kind of data, giving developers more flexibility.

However, in many cases, threads don't need to return a value, so the return value is typically set to `NULL`:

```c
return NULL;
```

### 3. **C Language Limitations**
C lacks function overloading (like in C++), which means all thread functions must follow the same prototype. By enforcing the use of `void*` for both the argument and return type, POSIX ensures that the `pthread_create` function can call any thread function, regardless of what specific data you want to pass in or return.

### Summary
- **`void* arg`**: The `void*` argument allows passing any kind of data to the thread function, which you can cast to the appropriate type inside the function.
- **`void* return`**: The `void*` return type allows the thread to return any type of data or no data (`NULL`).

This design provides flexibility and generality, which are essential in a low-level, language like C where you often deal with raw memory and pointers.
