8. **assert.h**:
   - **Use**: Debugging, provides the `assert()` macro for checking assumptions during program execution.

These are some of the commonly used standard libraries in C, each serving various purposes to aid in programming tasks.









Certainly! Here's a brief explanation of each of the included libraries in your C++ code:

1. **`#include <cstdint>`**
   - This header file includes fixed-width integer types. It provides typedefs for integer types with a specified width, such as `int8_t`, `uint8_t`, `int16_t`, `uint16_t`, `int32_t`, `uint32_t`, `int64_t`, and `uint64_t`. These types are useful when you need integers of a specific size, which is important for portability and consistency across different platforms.

2. **`#include <fstream>`**
   - This header file includes classes and functions for handling file input and output. It provides the `std::ifstream` class for reading from files, `std::ofstream` class for writing to files, and `std::fstream` class for both reading and writing. It also includes functions for file stream manipulation.

3. **`#include <iomanip>`**
   - This header file includes functions and manipulators for stream input and output formatting. It provides manipulators such as `std::setw` (set width), `std::setprecision` (set precision), `std::setfill` (set fill character), and others. These manipulators are used to format the way data is displayed in streams, which is useful for creating neatly formatted output.

4. **`#include <iostream>`**
   - This header file includes standard input and output stream objects and functions. It provides the `std::cin` object for reading from the standard input (keyboard), `std::cout` object for writing to the standard output (console), and `std::cerr` object for writing error messages to the standard error stream. It also includes various stream manipulators for controlling input and output formatting.

5. **`#include <sstream>`**
   - This header file includes string stream classes for input and output operations on strings. It provides the `std::stringstream` class, which can be used to perform input and output operations on `std::string` objects. This is useful for converting between strings and other data types, and for manipulating strings as streams.

6. **`#include <string>`**
   - This header file includes the `std::string` class and related functions for handling and manipulating strings. The `std::string` class provides a way to store and manipulate sequences of characters. It includes functions for concatenation, comparison, searching, and other string operations.

In summary, these headers collectively provide the necessary tools for handling various aspects of input and output, both for files and streams, as well as for working with specific integer types and strings in a portable and consistent manner.

### Notes:
- For `std::unordered_set`, `std::unordered_map`, `std::unordered_multimap`, and `std::unordered_multiset`, the worst-case time complexities occur when many elements hash to the same bucket, leading to degraded performance.
- `std::set` and `std::map` maintain elements in sorted order, while their unordered counterparts do not guarantee order but offer faster average-case performance.
