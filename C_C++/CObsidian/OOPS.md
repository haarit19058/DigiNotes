Great! I’ll prepare a detailed explanation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) tailored to your experience with C++ and focus on how it relates to data structures, algorithms, and competitive programming. I’ll also include code examples, explanations of key concepts (like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.), and tips on using OOP effectively in real problems.

# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++: A Guide for Competitive Programmers

Object-oriented programming (OOP) in C++ is a paradigm that **bundles data and behavior into “classes” and “objects”**, enabling modular, reusable code. A *class* is a user-defined type that acts as a blueprint for objects. Each *object* is an instance of a class with its own memory (for example, a `Point` class defines `x` and `y` coordinates, and each `Point` object has specific values). This grouping of data (attributes) and functions (methods) prevents unrelated code from directly accessing internal details. For instance, you might declare:

```cpp
class Point {
public:
    int x, y;
    Point(int x=0, int y=0): x(x), y(y) {}
    double distance(const Point &o) const {
        return sqrt((x-o.x)*(x-o.x) + (y-o.y)*(y-o.y));
    }
};

int main() {
    Point a(1,2), b(4,6);
    std::cout << a.distance(b) << "\n";  // Uses Point::distance
}
```

This `Point` class encapsulates coordinate data and a distance method.

## Core OOP Concepts

* **Classes and Objects:** A class defines a type (like `Animal` or `Point`) and its interface. It contains *data members* (fields) and *member functions* (methods). An object is an instance of the class with its own memory. For example, `Animal dog;` creates an `Animal` object `dog`.

* **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is *bundling data and the functions that operate on it within a class*, often using access specifiers (`private`, `public`) to **hide internal details**. In the `Point` example above, we could make `x` and `y` private and only allow access through methods. This ensures, for instance, that one cannot set `x` arbitrarily without going through the class’s interface. As GeeksforGeeks explains, encapsulation “binds together the data and the functions that manipulate them”.

* **Abstraction:** Abstraction means **exposing only the essential features** of a class and hiding implementation details. For example, a priority-queue class might expose methods like `push()` and `pop()` without revealing that it uses a binary heap internally. In C++, abstraction often uses classes (and abstract base classes with pure virtual methods) to provide a clear interface. The user of a class `Shape` need only know there is an `area()` method, without caring how each shape computes its area.

* **Inheritance:** Inheritance lets one class (*derived class*) **inherit properties and behaviors from another (*base class*)**, promoting code reuse. For example, a `Dog` class can inherit from `Animal` and automatically have `Animal`’s data and methods. In C++:

  ```cpp
  class Animal {
  public:
      std::string name;
      void breathe() { /*...*/ }
  };
  class Dog : public Animal {
  public:
      void bark() { /*...*/ }
  };
  ```

  Here `Dog` has both `name` and `breathe()` from `Animal` plus its own `bark()`. Inheritance hierarchies form a “is-a” relationship (a Dog *is an* Animal).

* **Polymorphism:** Polymorphism means “many forms”. In C++ this appears as *compile-time* (static) and *run-time* (dynamic) polymorphism. Compile-time polymorphism is when the compiler resolves which function to call based on the context (function or operator overloading). For example, you can overload a function or operator to behave differently depending on argument types. Run-time polymorphism uses inheritance and virtual functions. A base-class pointer can invoke derived-class methods based on the actual object type at run-time. For instance, if `Animal` has a virtual `speak()` and `Dog` overrides it, then:

  ```cpp
  class Animal {
  public:
      virtual void speak() const { std::cout << "..."; }
  };
  class Dog : public Animal {
  public:
      void speak() const override { std::cout << "Woof"; }
  };
  int main() {
      Animal *pet = new Dog();
      pet->speak();  // Prints "Woof", not "..."
  }
  ```

  This runtime decision is called dynamic binding. By contrast, non-virtual methods (or overloaded functions) are bound at compile-time. GeeksforGeeks notes that in compile-time polymorphism, the compiler determines which function to call by argument types, whereas in run-time polymorphism it’s based on the object’s actual type.

## Practical C++ Code Examples

### Defining and Using Classes

In C++, you define a class with the `class` keyword and members inside. For example:

```cpp
class Counter {
private:
    int count;                    // private data
public:
    Counter(): count(0) {}        // constructor
    void increment() { ++count; } // public method
    int getCount() const {        // public accessor
        return count;
    }
};

int main() {
    Counter c;
    c.increment();
    std::cout << c.getCount() << "\n";  // Prints 1
}
```

This `Counter` class *encapsulates* the integer `count`. Only the methods `increment()` and `getCount()` can manipulate it, protecting the data from unintended changes.

### Inheritance Hierarchies

Inheritance allows building class hierarchies. For example:

```cpp
class Person {
public:
    std::string name;
    Person(const std::string &n): name(n) {}
    virtual void role() const { 
        std::cout << "Person"; 
    }
};

class Student : public Person {
    int id;
public:
    Student(const std::string &n, int id): Person(n), id(id) {}
    void role() const override { 
        std::cout << "Student"; 
    }
};

int main() {
    Person *p = new Student("Alice", 42);
    std::cout << p->name << " is a ";
    p->role();   // Calls Student::role(), output: "Alice is a Student"
    delete p;
}
```

Here, `Student` inherits `name` from `Person` and overrides the virtual method `role()`. Even though `p` is a `Person*`, calling `p->role()` invokes `Student`’s implementation due to dynamic dispatch.

### Operator Overloading

C++ lets you **overload operators** to make classes more natural to use. For instance, a complex-number class:

```cpp
struct Complex {
    double re, im;
    Complex(double r=0, double i=0): re(r), im(i) {}
    Complex operator+(const Complex &o) const {
        return Complex(re + o.re, im + o.im);
    }
};

int main() {
    Complex a(1,2), b(3,4);
    Complex c = a + b;  // uses overloaded operator+
    std::cout << c.re << " + " << c.im << "i\n";  // "4 + 6i"
}
```

This lets you write `a + b` instead of a function call like `a.add(b)`. Common overloaded operators in CP include `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` for number classes, or `[]` for custom containers.

### Virtual Functions and Abstract Classes

An **abstract class** in C++ has one or more *pure virtual* methods (declared with `= 0`). For example, a `Shape` class with a pure virtual `area()`:

```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual double area() const = 0; // pure virtual
};

class Rectangle : public Shape {
    double w, h;
public:
    Rectangle(double w, double h): w(w), h(h) {}
    double area() const override {
        return w * h;
    }
};

int main() {
    Shape *s = new Rectangle(3.0, 4.0);
    std::cout << s->area() << "\n";  // Prints "12"
    delete s;
}
```

Here `Shape` is abstract (cannot be instantiated), and `Rectangle` provides the concrete `area()` method. Using `Shape*` allows code to work with any derived shape via polymorphism.

## Best Practices in Competitive Programming

* **When to Use OOP:** In contest problems that naturally involve multiple interacting entities or complex state (e.g. simulations, games, geometry), OOP can help structure the solution. For example, modeling a graph with a `Graph` class that has methods for BFS/DFS or a set of `Entity` classes in a simulation can improve clarity. However, for straightforward algorithmic problems (like a single dynamic programming or greedy task), simple functions or structs are often quicker to write. Overusing classes for tiny tasks may add boilerplate without benefit.

* **Pros of OOP:** OOP *modularizes* code—classes group related data and functions, improving readability. Inheritance allows **code reuse** and cleaner abstractions (e.g. multiple shapes all share a base `Shape`). Encapsulation and abstraction hide implementation details, reducing bugs and focusing on high-level logic. Operator overloading and templates (not strictly OOP but related) can make code concise (e.g. writing `a + b` for big integers). Overall, OOP can make complex solutions easier to manage and debug.

* **Cons of OOP:** There is some **overhead** in certain OOP features. Virtual function calls incur a slight runtime cost, and use of pointers or dynamic allocation can reduce cache-friendliness. In tight loops or low-level algorithms, this can matter. One StackExchange answer warns that “object orientation may prevent certain algorithmic optimizations, because of encapsulation”. In contests, simpler procedural code often compiles and runs slightly faster. Also, writing many classes and methods can slow coding speed. Therefore, reserve OOP for when its clarity outweighs its verbosity or overhead.

* **Class Design Tips for Trees/Graphs:**

  * **Graphs:** You can create a `Graph` class with an adjacency list and member functions (`addEdge()`, `bfs()`, etc.). This encapsulates graph logic. For example:

    ```cpp
    class Graph {
    public:
        int N;
        vector<vector<int>> adj;
        Graph(int n): N(n), adj(n) {}
        void addEdge(int u,int v) {
            adj[u].push_back(v);
            adj[v].push_back(u);
        }
        vector<int> bfs(int start) {
            vector<int> dist(N, -1);
            queue<int> q;
            dist[start] = 0;
            q.push(start);
            while(!q.empty()) {
                int u = q.front(); q.pop();
                for(int v: adj[u]) {
                    if(dist[v] < 0) {
                        dist[v] = dist[u] + 1;
                        q.push(v);
                    }
                }
            }
            return dist;
        }
    };
    ```

    This is clean, but if the problem is simple, a global `vector<vector<int>> adj;` plus a free function might be faster to write.
  * **Trees:** You might use a simple `struct TreeNode { int val; TreeNode *left, *right; };` for BFS/DFS, or a `Tree` class with insertion/search methods. Keep node classes lightweight (just data and pointers). If recursion is all that’s needed, a class may be unnecessary.
  * **General Tips:** Make small methods `inline` (define them inside the class) for speed. Mark const-correctness on methods to prevent bugs. Use `struct` (members public by default) for plain data holders to reduce boilerplate. Avoid deep inheritance in time-critical code; prefer composition or simple utilities unless polymorphism is truly needed.

## Sample Problems and Patterns

* **Disjoint Set (Union-Find) Class:** A common CP tool is a DSU class for connectivity or MST problems. For example:

  ```cpp
  class DSU {
      vector<int> p, r;
  public:
      DSU(int n): p(n), r(n,0) {
          for(int i=0;i<n;i++) p[i] = i;
      }
      int find(int x) {
          return p[x]==x ? x : p[x]=find(p[x]);
      }
      bool unite(int a,int b) {
          a = find(a); b = find(b);
          if(a==b) return false;
          if(r[a] < r[b]) std::swap(a,b);
          p[b] = a;
          if(r[a]==r[b]) r[a]++;
          return true;
      }
  };
  // Usage: DSU uf(n); uf.unite(u,v); bool same = (uf.find(x)==uf.find(y));
  ```

  Encapsulating union-find logic in a class makes the code reusable across problems.

* **Fenwick/Segment Tree Class:** Range query data structures are often written as classes. For example, a Fenwick tree (BIT):

  ```cpp
  class Fenwick {
      int n;
      vector<int> f;
  public:
      Fenwick(int n): n(n), f(n+1,0) {}
      void update(int i,int v) { for(; i<=n; i+=i&-i) f[i]+=v; }
      int query(int i) { int s=0; for(; i>0; i-=i&-i) s+=f[i]; return s; }
  };
  ```

  This hides the index arithmetic and allows code like `bit.update(i, val); bit.query(i);`.

* **Geometry and Custom Types:** In geometry or number-theory problems, defining classes can simplify operations. For instance, a `ModInt` class for modular arithmetic can overload `+,-,*` to handle mod automatically. A `Point` or `Vector` class can include methods for dot/cross products. Example (mod integer):

  ```cpp
  const int MOD = 1000000007;
  struct ModInt {
      long long v;
      ModInt(long long x=0) { v = (x%MOD+MOD)%MOD; }
      ModInt operator+(const ModInt &o) const { return ModInt(v+o.v); }
      ModInt operator*(const ModInt &o) const { return ModInt(v*o.v); }
      // ... (subtract, power, etc.)
  };
  // Usage: ModInt a(2), b(5); ModInt c = a*b + a;
  ```

  This ensures all arithmetic stays within `MOD` without cluttering the main code.

* **Abstract Problem Patterns:** Some contest problems involve handling different “types” with a common interface. For example, you might have an abstract `Query` class with derived classes `AddEdge`, `RemoveEdge`, `CheckConnectivity` each implementing a `process()` method. Using polymorphism here can make the driver code simpler by treating all queries uniformly. However, such scenarios are less common.

In summary, **use OOP when it clarifies your solution or avoids code duplication**, especially for complex problems with many components. Otherwise, a procedural approach can be more concise for straightforward algorithmic tasks. Balancing clarity and performance is key: remember that features like virtual functions bring flexibility, but also a bit of overhead. Keep classes lean, focus on constant-time methods, and leverage C++ features (like templates and operator overloading) to make your contest code both efficient and readable.
