Dary heaps Evry node has d childs.

Here is a table summarizing the time complexity of **d-ary heaps**, a generalization of binary heaps where each node has dd children:

|**Operation**|**Binary Heap (d=2d=2)**|**d-ary Heap**|**Explanation**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Insertion**|O(log⁡2n)O(\log_2 n)|O(log⁡dn)O(\log_d n)|Time for insertion is proportional to the height of the heap.|
|**Decrease Key**|O(log⁡2n)O(\log_2 n)|O(log⁡dn)O(\log_d n)|Requires bubbling up the element, similar to insertion.|
|**Extract Min/Max**|O(log⁡2n)O(\log_2 n)|O(d⋅log⁡dn)O(d \cdot \log_d n)|Requires percolating down, which involves dd comparisons at each level.|
|**Delete**|O(log⁡2n)O(\log_2 n)|O(d⋅log⁡dn)O(d \cdot \log_d n)|Combines decrease key and extract min/max.|
|**Build Heap**|O(n)O(n)|O(n)O(n)|Bottom-up heap construction is linear for any dd.|

### Key Observations:

1. **Height of the Heap:**  
    The height of a dd-ary heap is O(log⁡dn)O(\log_d n), which decreases as dd increases.
    
2. **Trade-offs:**
    
    - Increasing dd reduces the height of the heap but increases the number of comparisons needed for operations like percolating down.
    - Optimal choice for dd depends on the specific use case and hardware considerations (e.g., cache locality).
3. **Binary vs d-ary:**  
    Binary heaps (d=2d=2) are commonly used because they strike a balance between height and percolation cost. However, dd-ary heaps with higher dd may perform better in scenarios with frequent insertions and decrease key operations.




# Young Tableaus

An m × n Young tableau is an m × n matrix such that the entries of each
row are in sorted order from left to right and the entries of each column
are in sorted order from top to bottom. Some of the entries of a Young
tableau may be ∞, which we treat as nonexistent elements. Thus, a
Young tableau can be used to hold r ≤ mn ﬁnite numbers.

# Amortized Meaning
Amortized refers to the process of distributing the cost of an operation over a sequence of operations, so that the average cost per operation is smaller than the worst-case cost of any individual operation. It is commonly used in the context of algorithm analysis to describe the average performance of a sequence of operations, rather than focusing on the worst-case performance of a single operation.

### Key Points:

- **Amortized Cost**: The average time or space complexity of an operation when considering the entire sequence of operations.
- **Example**: In data structures like dynamic arrays, an individual insertion may sometimes take a long time (e.g., when the array needs to be resized). However, if you amortize this cost over many insertions, the average time per insertion is much smaller.

### Types of Amortized Analysis:

1. **Aggregate Method**: The total cost of a sequence of operations is calculated, and then the cost per operation is averaged.
2. **Accounting Method**: Each operation is assigned a charge (or credit) that accounts for both its actual cost and its share of future operations.
3. **Potential Method**: Similar to the accounting method, but the "potential" of the data structure is tracked to reflect how much "work" is being saved for future operations.

### Example:

In a dynamic array, inserting an element typically costs O(1) time, but when the array is full, it may need to be resized, which takes O(n) time. However, because resizing only happens occasionally, the amortized cost per insertion remains O(1) when averaged over many insertions.







This passage discusses various advanced data structures and methods used to implement **priority queues** efficiently, focusing on how different approaches improve the time complexity of priority queue operations like `INSERT`, `EXTRACT-MIN`, and `DECREASE-KEY`. Let's break down each concept and method in detail:

### 1. **Min-Heaps and Min-Priority Queues**

A **min-heap** is a binary tree-based data structure where each parent node has a value less than or equal to its children. This property allows efficient access to the smallest element, which is always at the root of the heap.

A **min-priority queue** is an abstract data structure that supports operations to efficiently retrieve the smallest element, insert new elements, and decrease the value of an element. It is often implemented using a heap. The operations commonly supported by a min-priority queue are:

- **INSERT**: Insert a new element into the queue.
- **EXTRACT-MIN**: Remove and return the minimum element.
- **DECREASE-KEY**: Decrease the value of a specific element.

### 2. **Fibonacci Heaps**

Fibonacci heaps are a more advanced type of heap designed to improve the time complexity of certain operations, particularly for applications like **Dijkstra’s shortest-path algorithm**.

- **Fibonacci Heap**: A Fibonacci heap is a collection of heap-ordered trees. It is a **deferment**-oriented heap, meaning that it tries to delay work (such as reordering trees) as much as possible.
    - **INSERT**: Inserts a new element into the heap in **O(1)** amortized time.
    - **DECREASE-KEY**: Decreases the value of an element in **O(1)** amortized time.
    - **EXTRACT-MIN**: Removes the minimum element in **O(log n)** amortized time.

The amortized time complexity refers to the **average time** per operation over a sequence of operations, which can be very efficient in the long run, even if individual operations take longer.

- **Amortized Time**: This is an average time per operation when considered over a series of operations. While some individual operations might take longer, the amortized cost is the average time spent per operation over many operations.

Fredman and Tarjan's work [156] showed that Fibonacci heaps can support `INSERT` and `DECREASE-KEY` in **O(1)** amortized time, which makes them very efficient for algorithms like Dijkstra’s algorithm, where many `DECREASE-KEY` operations are required.

### 3. **Strict Fibonacci Heaps**

- **Strict Fibonacci Heaps**: These are a variation of Fibonacci heaps where the amortized time bounds become **actual worst-case running times**. In other words, operations such as `INSERT` and `DECREASE-KEY` have worst-case **O(1)** time rather than amortized time.

This improvement ensures that the time complexity is predictable, even in the worst case.

### 4. **Van Emde Boas Trees**

- **Van Emde Boas Trees**: This is a tree-based data structure that supports several operations on a set of keys drawn from the integers {0, 1, …, n-1}.
    - **Operations**:
        - `INSERT`: Insert an element.
        - `DELETE`: Delete an element.
        - `SEARCH`: Search for an element.
        - `MINIMUM`: Find the minimum element.
        - `MAXIMUM`: Find the maximum element.
        - `PREDECESSOR`: Find the largest element smaller than a given element.
        - `SUCCESSOR`: Find the smallest element greater than a given element.
    - These operations are supported in **O(log log n)** time, making them highly efficient for certain applications, especially when the set of keys is restricted to a known, small range.

### 5. **Fredman-Willard Data Structure**

Fredman and Willard [157] introduced a data structure that operates on **b-bit integers**, where the computer memory is divided into **b-bit words**. They showed that certain operations on priority queues could be performed more efficiently with this structure:

- **MINIMUM**: **O(1)** time.
- **INSERT** and **EXTRACT-MIN**: These can be performed in **O(log n)** time with this structure.

This is particularly useful when working with bit-level operations and fixed-length integers.

### 6. **Thorup's Improvement with Randomized Hashing**

Thorup [436] improved the time complexity of certain operations in priority queues by introducing **randomized hashing**. The use of hashing allows for more efficient handling of certain types of priority queue operations.

- **Improvement**: Thorup's approach reduces the time complexity for certain operations to **O(log log n)**. This is achieved using randomization techniques, where the keys are hashed to simplify certain operations, making them faster.

### 7. **Monotone Priority Queues**

In some applications, such as **Dijkstra's algorithm** or **discrete-event simulation**, the sequence of `EXTRACT-MIN` operations is **monotone**. This means that the values returned by successive `EXTRACT-MIN` operations are always increasing.

- **Monotone Case**: When the data consist of integers in a small range (1, 2, ..., C), there are optimized ways to implement priority queues:
    - **Radix Heap**: This data structure can implement `EXTRACT-MIN` and `INSERT` in **O(log C)** amortized time, and `DECREASE-KEY` in **O(1)** time.

In this setting, **C** is the number of distinct integer keys.

### 8. **Improvements with Fibonacci and Radix Heaps**

The combination of **Fibonacci heaps** and **radix heaps** can improve the time bounds further. For example, **Cherkassky, Goldberg, and Silverstein** [90] showed that the expected time for operations in this combined approach could be improved to **O(log^1/3 C)**.

Additionally, **Raman** [375] further improved these bounds to **O(min {log^1/4 C, log^1/3 n})**, where **ϵ > 0** is a small constant. This indicates that the time complexity can be made arbitrarily small by using advanced techniques and data structures, which is particularly useful for large-scale problems.

### 9. **Other Heap Variants**

The passage also mentions that various other heap variants have been proposed, including some described by **Brodal [72]**. These variants are typically designed to optimize specific operations in different settings or applications.

### Summary of Key Points

- **Min-Heaps**: Used for implementing min-priority queues with efficient operations.
- **Fibonacci Heaps**: Provide amortized **O(1)** time for `INSERT` and `DECREASE-KEY` operations, making them useful for Dijkstra’s algorithm.
- **Strict Fibonacci Heaps**: Guarantee actual worst-case time bounds of **O(1)** for `INSERT` and `DECREASE-KEY`.
- **Van Emde Boas Trees**: Provide **O(log log n)** time for several operations on integer keys from a small range.
- **Fredman-Willard**: A data structure that optimizes certain operations for **b-bit integers**.
- **Thorup's Randomized Hashing**: Improves time complexity for certain priority queue operations to **O(log log n)**.
- **Monotone Priority Queues**: Optimized for specific use cases like Dijkstra’s algorithm, with improvements from radix and Fibonacci heaps.
- **Other Heap Variants**: Various specialized heaps for particular applications or performance requirements.

These advanced data structures aim to improve the performance of priority queues, especially in scenarios where efficiency is critical, such as graph algorithms and simulations.
