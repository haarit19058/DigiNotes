You can access the raw data of a pendrive (or any storage device) in hexadecimal form using tools or by writing C/C++ code.

### 1. **Using Linux tools**

#### `xxd`

The `xxd` command is a simple tool that converts binary data into hexadecimal form.

1. Identify the device name of your pendrive. Use the following command to list storage devices:
    
    ```
    lsblk
    ```
    
    Your pendrive will typically be something like `/dev/sdb`.
    
2. Use `xxd` to convert the raw data into hexadecimal:
    
    ```
    sudo xxd /dev/sdb
    ```
    
    This will print the raw hexadecimal data from the pendrive. You can redirect the output to a file:
    
    ```
    sudo xxd /dev/sdb > pendrive.hex
    ```
    

#### `hexdump`

Another option is `hexdump`:

```
sudo hexdump -C /dev/sdb
```

### 2. **Using C/C++ code**

You can write a C/C++ program to open the pendrive and read its contents in hexadecimal form.

Here’s an example C code to read a raw device and display it in hexadecimal format:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdint.h>

void print_hex(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
    for (size_t i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        printf("%02x ", data[i]);
        if ((i + 1) % 16 == 0) {
            printf("\n");
        }
    }
    if (size % 16 != 0) {
        printf("\n");
    }
}

int main() {
    const char *device = "/dev/sdb"; // Change to your device
    int fd = open(device, O_RDONLY);
    if (fd == -1) {
        perror("Error opening device");
        return 1;
    }

    uint8_t buffer[512]; // Buffer to hold raw data
    ssize_t bytesRead;
    
    while ((bytesRead = read(fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer))) > 0) {
        print_hex(buffer, bytesRead);
    }

    if (bytesRead == -1) {
        perror("Error reading device");
    }

    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
```

### How it works:

- **Opening the pendrive:** The program opens the device (e.g., `/dev/sdb`) in read-only mode.
- **Reading data:** It reads data from the pendrive in chunks (512 bytes in this case, which is a typical block size).
- **Printing in hexadecimal:** It then prints the data in a human-readable hexadecimal format.

### Steps:

1. Compile the C code:
    
    ```
    gcc -o read_hex read_hex.c
    ```
    
2. Run the program with `sudo` (because accessing raw devices typically requires root privileges):
    
    ```
    sudo ./read_hex
    ```
    

This will print the raw hexadecimal data of your pendrive.

Yes, there are more efficient methods to access and store the raw data from your pendrive without inflating the size as much as the hexadecimal representation does. Some of the alternatives include:

### 1. **Storing Raw Binary Data**

Instead of converting the data into hexadecimal format, you can store it in its raw binary form. This will preserve the data without increasing the size. Here’s how you can do it:

#### Using `dd` command (Linux)

You can use the `dd` command to copy the raw data from your pendrive to a file without any conversion.

```bash
sudo dd if=/dev/sdb of=pendrive.raw bs=4M status=progress
```

- `if=/dev/sdb`: Specifies the input file (your pendrive device).
- `of=pendrive.raw`: Specifies the output file (the binary file where the raw data will be stored).
- `bs=4M`: Sets the block size for reading and writing (you can adjust it to any size).
- `status=progress`: Displays the progress during the copying process.

This method will store the raw binary data without expanding it into hexadecimal form, so the file size will be close to the actual size of the pendrive.

### 2. **Using C Code to Copy Data (Binary Format)**

You can modify the C code example I provided earlier to store the raw data in a binary file instead of printing it in hexadecimal.

Here’s a modified version of the C code to store the raw data in a binary file:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    const char *device = "/dev/sdb";  // Change this to your device
    const char *outputFile = "pendrive.raw";
    
    int fd = open(device, O_RDONLY);
    if (fd == -1) {
        perror("Error opening device");
        return 1;
    }

    FILE *outFile = fopen(outputFile, "wb");
    if (!outFile) {
        perror("Error opening output file");
        close(fd);
        return 1;
    }

    char buffer[512]; // Buffer to hold raw data
    ssize_t bytesRead;
    
    while ((bytesRead = read(fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer))) > 0) {
        fwrite(buffer, 1, bytesRead, outFile); // Write raw data to output file
    }

    if (bytesRead == -1) {
        perror("Error reading device");
    }

    fclose(outFile);
    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
```

### How it works:

- The program opens the pendrive as a raw device (`/dev/sdb`).
- It reads the raw binary data in chunks (512 bytes in this case) from the pendrive.
- It writes the data directly to a file (`pendrive.raw`) without converting it into hexadecimal.

### 3. **Compression**

If you want to reduce the size further (especially if your data contains some repetition), you can compress the binary data after you've copied it. For example:

```bash
sudo dd if=/dev/sdb | gzip > pendrive.raw.gz
```

This method will compress the binary data, reducing the file size, depending on the type of data on the pendrive.

### 4. **Using File System Snapshots or Disk Imaging**

If your pendrive contains a file system (like FAT32, NTFS, etc.), you can also consider creating a snapshot or disk image using a tool like **Clonezilla** or **partimage**. These tools will allow you to back up the entire file system with a compressed image, which could be more space-efficient than copying raw data in some cases.

### Conclusion:

- **Raw binary copy** (using `dd` or C code) is the most space-efficient way to store the data.
- **Compression** can further reduce the file size.
- **File system snapshots** or disk imaging might offer additional benefits if you want to preserve the structure of the pendrive’s data.

These methods will avoid the significant overhead of storing data in hexadecimal form and give you a more efficient representation of the raw data.

### **What is Huffman Encoding?**

Huffman encoding is a lossless data compression algorithm used to reduce the size of data by assigning variable-length codes to input characters. It is a **greedy algorithm** that creates an optimal prefix code (no code is a prefix of another), ensuring that more frequent characters are represented with shorter codes and less frequent characters with longer codes.

The main idea behind Huffman encoding is:

1. **Character Frequency Analysis**: First, the frequency of each character in the input data is determined.
2. **Building a Binary Tree**: A binary tree is then built, where each leaf node represents a character and its frequency. The tree is constructed in such a way that characters with higher frequencies are closer to the root, and those with lower frequencies are deeper in the tree.
3. **Encoding**: The tree structure allows the encoding to be performed by assigning binary strings (0s and 1s) to each character. More frequent characters are assigned shorter bit strings, and less frequent characters are assigned longer bit strings.

### **Steps to Encode with Huffman Encoding:**

1. **Frequency Calculation**: Count the frequency of each byte or character in the data.
2. **Building a Huffman Tree**: Construct a binary tree based on these frequencies. The most frequent bytes (or characters) will have shorter codes.
3. **Assigning Codes**: Assign binary codes to each byte (or character) based on the tree. These codes will be used to replace the original data.
4. **Compression**: Replace the original data with the corresponding Huffman codes, which usually results in a smaller file.

### **How Huffman Encoding Can Help Reduce the Size of Binary Data**

While Huffman encoding is a powerful method of compressing text data (or other structured data like images, etc.), its effectiveness depends on the **frequency distribution of the data**. For **binary data**, Huffman encoding might not always give dramatic reductions unless there are repetitive patterns or certain bytes appear more frequently than others.

If the binary data you are working with has certain repeating patterns or byte sequences (such as some bytes appearing more frequently), Huffman encoding can be effective in compressing the data size.

### **Can Huffman Encoding Be Used for Binary Data?**

Yes, Huffman encoding can be used on **binary data** (like the raw contents of your pendrive), but you would typically apply it at the byte level. Here’s how:

1. **Input**: The binary data can be split into bytes (8 bits each).
2. **Frequency Count**: You would count the frequency of each byte (from 0x00 to 0xFF).
3. **Huffman Encoding**: Based on the frequency of each byte, you build the Huffman tree and generate binary codes for each byte.
4. **Encoded Output**: The result is a compressed version of the original binary data, with each byte being replaced by a shorter or longer binary code.

#### Example of Using Huffman Encoding for Binary Data

Let’s say you have a binary sequence of bytes like:

```
[0x01, 0x01, 0x02, 0x01, 0x03, 0x03, 0x01]
```

1. **Step 1**: Count the frequency of each byte:
    
    - `0x01` appears 4 times
    - `0x03` appears 2 times
    - `0x02` appears 1 time
2. **Step 2**: Build the Huffman tree based on these frequencies:
    
    ```
    0x01: 4
    0x03: 2
    0x02: 1
    ```
    
    After constructing the tree, you would assign the following codes:
    
    - `0x01` → `0`
    - `0x03` → `10`
    - `0x02` → `11`
3. **Step 3**: Replace the original bytes with their Huffman codes:
    
    ```
    Original: [0x01, 0x01, 0x02, 0x01, 0x03, 0x03, 0x01]
    Encoded:  [0, 0, 11, 0, 10, 10, 0]
    ```
    

### **Real-World Considerations:**

- **Compression Ratio**: Huffman encoding works best when there are significant variations in the frequency of bytes. If all bytes are approximately equally frequent (which is common in truly random data), Huffman encoding won’t be as effective.
- **Overhead**: Huffman encoding adds a small overhead (the tree needs to be stored along with the compressed data). For small datasets or datasets with high entropy (randomness), the overhead can sometimes negate the benefits of compression.
- **Binary Data**: For raw binary data (like from a pendrive), Huffman encoding can still reduce the size, but the effect depends on how "compressible" the data is. If the data has repeating byte patterns, the compression will be more effective.

### **Practical Use with C/C++**

You can use libraries like **zlib** (which internally uses Huffman coding) for this purpose. Here's a simplified approach using `zlib` in C for compression:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <zlib.h>

int compress_file(const char *input_file, const char *output_file) {
    FILE *in = fopen(input_file, "rb");
    FILE *out = fopen(output_file, "wb");
    if (!in || !out) return -1;

    z_stream strm;
    unsigned char in_buf[1024];
    unsigned char out_buf[1024];
    int ret;

    strm.zalloc = Z_NULL;
    strm.zfree = Z_NULL;
    strm.avail_in = 0;
    strm.next_in = Z_NULL;

    ret = deflateInit(&strm, Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION);
    if (ret != Z_OK) return ret;

    do {
        strm.avail_in = fread(in_buf, 1, sizeof(in_buf), in);
        if (ferror(in)) return -1;
        if (strm.avail_in == 0) break;

        strm.next_in = in_buf;

        do {
            strm.avail_out = sizeof(out_buf);
            strm.next_out = out_buf;

            ret = deflate(&strm, Z_FINISH);
            if (ret == Z_STREAM_ERROR) return ret;

            unsigned have = sizeof(out_buf) - strm.avail_out;
            if (fwrite(out_buf, 1, have, out) != have || ferror(out)) return -1;
        } while (strm.avail_out == 0);
    } while (strm.avail_in > 0);

    deflateEnd(&strm);
    fclose(in);
    fclose(out);
    return Z_OK;
}

int main() {
    compress_file("pendrive.raw", "pendrive_compressed.gz");
    return 0;
}
```

This example uses **zlib** to compress a binary file with the `deflate` algorithm, which internally uses Huffman coding.

### **Conclusion:**

Huffman encoding can be used to reduce the size of binary data, but its effectiveness depends on the structure of the data. For highly random data, the compression may not be very significant. However, for data with repetitive byte patterns or predictable byte sequences, Huffman encoding can offer significant space savings. You can implement it using libraries like `zlib` or by writing your own custom implementation in C/C++.
