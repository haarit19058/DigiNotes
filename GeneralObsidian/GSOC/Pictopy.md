# Husky 

Husky is a tool that helps enforce Git hooks in a project. Git hooks are scripts that run automatically at certain points in the Git workflow (e.g., before commits, pushes, or merges). Husky allows you to configure these hooks to automate tasks like running linters, tests, or other checks before performing actions such as committing or pushing changes.

For example, Husky can be set up to run a linter every time a commit is made, ensuring that the code adheres to the specified coding standards before it's committed to the repository. This helps maintain code quality and consistency across the team.

Husky is commonly used in JavaScript/TypeScript projects, but it can be integrated into projects using other languages as well.


# Linters

Linters are tools used in software development to analyze code for potential errors, bugs, or violations of coding standards and best practices. They automatically scan your source code and identify issues like syntax errors, stylistic inconsistencies, and patterns that could lead to bugs or performance problems.

Linters help improve code quality by providing feedback on:

1. **Syntax errors**: Issues like missing parentheses, mismatched brackets, etc.
2. **Code style**: Enforcing consistent formatting, such as indentation, naming conventions, and spacing.
3. **Best practices**: Identifying inefficient or incorrect coding practices, like using deprecated functions or unnecessary complexity.
4. **Potential bugs**: Warning about possible logical errors that could lead to runtime issues.

For example, in JavaScript, tools like ESLint can enforce coding conventions, while in Python, Pylint or Flake8 can perform similar functions. These tools can be integrated into the development workflow to run automatically during tasks like commits or before builds.




# Project Ideas



Here are some robust and challenging ideas for contributing to PictoPy during GSoC:

### 1. **Real-time Face Recognition and Clustering**

- Implement real-time facial recognition and clustering directly within the gallery, allowing users to group and tag faces dynamically.
- Integrate efficient streaming pipelines using ONNX Runtime to ensure smooth performance for high-resolution images.

### 2. **Enhanced Search with Natural Language Processing**

- Develop a smart search feature using NLP to allow queries like "Find photos with two people outdoors" or "Images with John taken in 2022."
- Use pre-trained language models (e.g., OpenAI embeddings) and link them with metadata and detected objects.

### 3. **Custom Model Training for Personalization**

- Add functionality for users to fine-tune YOLO or FaceNet models on their own dataset for personalized object or face detection.
- Include a GUI for labeling and managing custom datasets directly in the app.

### 4. **Advanced Privacy Features**

- Implement end-to-end encryption for sensitive image metadata, ensuring privacy when syncing across devices.
- Develop local anonymization techniques to blur or replace faces in photos automatically.

### 5. **Time-Series-Based Photo Visualization**

- Create a feature to display photos on a timeline, incorporating filters like "group by day/week/month" or "highlight important events."

### 6. **Offline Map and Geotagging Integration**

- Integrate offline maps (using tools like OpenStreetMap) to visualize geotagged photos, cluster them by location, and enable location-based search.

### 7. **Image Editing and Annotation Tools**

- Add basic image editing capabilities like cropping, color adjustments, and annotations with smart suggestions based on detected objects.
- Allow exporting annotated images as separate files or embedding metadata.

### 8. **Hybrid Cloud Synchronization**

- Design a system to sync gallery data across multiple devices while keeping sensitive data offline.
- Use Rust for secure and efficient handling of local storage and syncing logic.

### 9. **Scalable Cluster Visualization**

- Develop a visually appealing interface for representing clusters of similar images or faces, integrating interactive zooming and splitting.

### 10. **AI-Powered Album Suggestions**

- Implement algorithms to suggest photo albums based on detected themes, such as "Family Trip," "Birthday," or "Nature."

If any of these ideas resonate, I can help you expand on them further or assist with creating a detailed proposal.
