## Task analysis

- uncertain death of plants even though taking care regularly.
- soil is not suitable for the plants.
- Climate is not proper for the plant.
- For testing the soil one has to take it to the lab for testing it, but our product gives onsite service and within one-two minute.
- Over logging of water in the plants either due to human mistakes or natural causes.
- Adding of excess  fetilizers.
- Some plants require more light and some don't.
- For greenhouse temperature needs to be in specific range so this device can measure it as well.
- Farmer doesn't need to be literate for using the device. (User-Friendly)
