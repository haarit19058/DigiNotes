Good morning, friends.

Have you ever envisioned a future where traveling abroad doesn't involve the hassle of currency conversion? Or perhaps you have a sibling studying overseas who urgently needs funds. Traditionally, such transactions could take days, burdened with heavy fees. What if I told you that there's a revolutionary technology that could make these concerns obsolete? Thanks to an innovation from India in 2016 called UPI, or Unified Payment Interface, this vision is fast becoming a reality.

Imagine a world where we are no longer reliant on international giants like Visa and Mastercard for cross-border transactions. UPI, a homegrown technology, has the potential to make India a financial powerhouse, independent in the context of global trade.

Let’s delve into the evolution of payment systems to understand the groundbreaking impact of UPI:

Prior to UPI, India introduced RTGS in 2004, a system managed by IDRBT for real-time gross settlements. Although effective for large transactions, RTGS was costly, catering only to transfers above 2 lakh rupees. To address smaller transactions, RBI launched NEFT in 2005, which allowed the transfer of amounts as small as one rupee, but these too were batch-processed, causing delays.

In 2010, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) introduced IMPS for immediate transactions up to 2 lakh rupees. However, it required details like MMID numbers and was restricted to mobile usage, lacking versatility.

Then, in 2016, the NPCI revolutionized the landscape with UPI. It operates on a 24/7 basis across the entire country, leveraging the existing IMPS network. What sets UPI apart is its simplicity and security—it uses a Virtual Payment Address linked to your mobile number and bank account, functioning with robust dual-factor authentication.

Now, consider this: as of March 2024, UPI has facilitated transactions worth over 19.78 lakh crore rupees! The transparency of UPI transactions ensures minimal corruption and its digital nature is environmentally friendly—no need for the physical production and circulation of notes.

On the international front, the demand for UPI is surging. Under India’s presidency of the G20, we’ve showcased UPI’s capabilities to global leaders. In February 2023, India signed MoUs with 13 countries keen on integrating UPI. A prime example is the successful linkage between UPI and Singapore’s PayNow, which now allows real-time, secure, and cost-effective remittances, expanding possibilities for businesses and individuals alike.

This linkage means that Indian students in Singapore can receive money instantly from their families. Businesses can make seamless payments to Singaporean suppliers using UPI, integrating India more deeply into global commerce.

In conclusion, UPI is not just changing how we transact financially—it is redefining it. It makes international payments convenient, swift, and economical, positioning India at the forefront of the global financial landscape. As UPI continues to grow, it supports our transition to a digital economy and significantly cuts down corruption.

Let us embrace UPI and champion this technology, not just for its convenience but for the financial independence it promises India on a global stage. Join me in supporting and advocating for UPI, a true testament to India’s innovative spirit and technological prowess.

Thank you.
