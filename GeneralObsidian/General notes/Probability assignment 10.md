This dataset provides detailed information about each match, including player rankings, scores, and betting odds. It's commonly used for analysis and prediction in the world of tennis.




Bet365 is one of the world's leading online gambling companies. It offers a wide range of betting options, including sports betting, online casino games, poker, and bingo. Established in 2000 in Stoke-on-Trent, England, by Denise Coates, Bet365 has grown to become one of the largest online gambling platforms globally, serving millions of customers in various countries.

In the context of the provided dataset, "B365W" and "B365L" refer to the betting odds for the winning and losing players, respectively, as provided by Bet365. These odds represent the potential payout for a successful bet placed on each player.




Betting odds for the winning player represent the likelihood, as assessed by the bookmaker, that the specified player will win the match. These odds are expressed as a numerical ratio or fraction and indicate the potential payout for a successful bet placed on that player. 

For example, if the betting odds for the winning player are 1.50, it means that for every unit of currency (e.g., dollar, euro) wagered on that player, the bettor stands to receive 1.50 units of currency in return if the player wins. 

Lower odds generally indicate that the player is considered more likely to win, while higher odds suggest that the player is less likely to win. Bettors use these odds to make informed decisions when placing bets, considering factors such as the players' performance, rankings, and other relevant statistics.
