Hereâ€™s an explanation of each command and its purpose in your process of creating a portfolio website:

### Setting up the Vite environment

1. **`npm create vite@latest`**  
    This command initializes a new Vite project. It downloads the Vite setup package and prompts you to configure the project (e.g., choose a framework like React). Vite is a fast build tool and development server.
    
2. **`cd directory`**  
    Changes the working directory to the folder created for your Vite project. Replace `directory` with the actual name of your project folder.
    
3. **`npm run dev`**  
    Starts the Vite development server. It allows you to see your application in the browser with live reloading as you make changes.

### Installing Tailwind CSS

4. **`npm install -D tailwindcss`**  
    Installs Tailwind CSS as a development dependency (`-D`) in your project. Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework that provides pre-designed classes for styling your website.
    
5. **`npx tailwind init`**  
    Creates a `tailwind.config.js` file in your project. This file allows you to customize the configuration of Tailwind (e.g., theme colors, fonts, etc.).

### Installing other packages

6. **`npm install --legacy-peer-deps @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei maath react-tilt react-vertical-timeline-component @emailjs/browser framer-motion react-router-dom`**  
    This installs various libraries and dependencies you'll use in your portfolio project:
    
    - **`@react-three/fiber`**: A React renderer for Three.js, used to create 3D content on the web.
    - **`@react-three/drei`**: A collection of helpers and utilities for React Three Fiber to simplify 3D development.
    - **`maath`**: Provides mathematical utilities for 3D rendering and animations.
    - **`react-tilt`**: Adds tilt and hover effects to your components for a modern interactive feel.
    - **`react-vertical-timeline-component`**: Helps create beautiful vertical timelines, which are often used in portfolios to display work experience or projects.
    - **`@emailjs/browser`**: A library to send emails directly from the browser using the EmailJS service, which can be useful for contact forms.
    - **`framer-motion`**: A library for creating smooth and customizable animations in React.
    - **`react-router-dom`**: Provides routing capabilities for React, enabling navigation between different pages of your portfolio.
    
    **`--legacy-peer-deps`** is used to resolve potential dependency conflicts, ensuring that npm installs these packages correctly.
