# To my parents

I do not know what i am doing. I feel you wasted your money on me. I am disturbed by a friend and a girl i think i loved. But both of them just wanted to use me. V always treated me like a child who does not know how to speak and acted like it. An immature child. I do not know what should i do. I hve wasted my previous semester because of these two people. And the guy is so selfish that he always think of himself. It seems like i am very weak to live in this world with what imy ideals that are of no use.

I have seen worse people get succesful. I tried but seems like it is not making sense. I feell like what ever i do is of no use and maybe i do not have the capacity to bring happiness to our family. This all that i could do. I am sorry if i could nto do better, soorry pa and ma.

Maybe in next life i will do better. 


I will still try hoping that it would do somethign better.
