# Part 1. The Two systems

## The characters of the story

Introducing the two systems by examples.
- The photo of a woman: Did not need to think hard, all the conclusions just happend instantaneously
- 17x24: Takes time but you had intuitive though or idea of range of answers. e.g. 123 and 100000 are not possible answers

### Two Systems
- System 1 operates automatically and quickly with little or no effort and no sense of coluntary control
- System2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activites that demand it including complex computations. The operations of system 2 are often associated wiht the subjective experience of agency choice and concentration.

The auto matic operations of system 1 generate surprisingly complex patterns of idea but onlt the system 2 can construct thoughts in an orderly series of steps.
The two systems have their indicidual abilities limitations and functions.


The control of attention is shared by boht the systems. Orienting to a loud sound is normally  involuntary operation fo system 1, which immediately mobilizes the voluntary attention of system 2.

System 2 has some ability to change the way system 1 works, by programming the normally automatic functions of attention and memory.e.g. when waiting at the busstop for a relative at a busy train station, for example, you can set yourself at will to look for a white haired woman or a bearded man and thereby increase the likelihood of detecting your relative from a distance.
- I do the same when doing tasks. First boil down to simple one and then instruct the system 1 to do it. For example finding words in wordfindign game or solving a maze. Solving easy sudokus

You dipose a limited budget of attention that you can allocate to activities and if you try to go beyound it you will fail. e.g. you cannot compute 17x24 while making a left turn into the dense traffic

You can do several things at once if they are easy and undemanding. Or you can increase your budget if you train your brain to do so.
Just like (i do not remember who but someone famous said) that he used to count till 51 and then reset it. Initially it was tough but later his brain learnt to do it effortlessy. 

- Just make new neuron connections and that is all......

The invisible Gorilla effect: Intense focusing can make people effectively blind even to stimuli that normally react to. **We can be blind to the obvious and we are also blind to our blindnes**


### Plot synopsis
### Conflict
The experimetn of left/right.
It creates a conflict between two systems


### Illusions
Muller-Lyer illusion : lines with fins
What we see is not always true. It is the system 1 telling you that the lines are not equal. But use the 2 and take a ruler , measure the line and they are same in fact.

The psycopathic patient example.

Learning: Do not trust what you see, use your system 2 or logical reasoning to figure out what is going on around you....


## Attention and Effort

- One of the main characteristic of system 2 is its laziness the reluctance to invest more effort thatn is strictly necessay. 

### Mental Effort

Activity to use the most of system 2. ADD-1 and ADD-3 activities
And teh lab experiment fo kahnman with opticians setup the v shaped graph

The changing size of the pupil  a faithful record of how hard you worked.
The pupil of the eye is the window to soul.

The pupil appears dilated in the attractive picture and constricted in another. You want to take more in when you are inteerested. When you see someone you love your pupil size tend to dilate. 

Hess's findings:  pupil dilates substantially then multiplying two digit numbers and even more if problems are harder.


As ssyou become skilled at  a task, its demand for energy decreases. Highgly intelligent individuals needs less effort for similar problems as indicaetd by dilated pupils

Laziness is built deep into our nature. We tend to take the path where teh effort is least.

A crucial capability of sytem 2 is the adoption of 'task sets': it can program memory to obey an instruction thta overrides hebitual responses. Switching from one task to another is efforful especially under time comsuming pressure.
e.g. count the f in teh page and then try to count teh commas in the page.


Modern tests of workign memory require th individual to switch repeatedly between two demandign takss sretaining theresults of oen operationwhile performing the other. People who do well on these tests tend to do well on general intelligence.

However the ability to control attention is not simply a measure of intelligence; measure of efficiency in the control of attention predict performance of ...
